//Dread and despair slowly fill your lungs. 
//You've failed. It was just as they said.
//You just weren't good enough. 
//Were you born this way? Or maybe it was your fault all along?
//Ultimately you'll never know.
//What's sure is that you'll never get the Golden Duck.
//The only thought that gives you some solace is that perhaps none of it really mattered.
//That in the end, you'll die.
//THE END
