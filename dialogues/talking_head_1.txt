/TALKING HEAD (LV 81): It's nothing personal. You just weren't good enough.
/TALKING HEAD (LV 81): As you know, our system chooses the best candidates based on your Life Value, LV for short.
/TALKING HEAD (LV 81): Which in turn can be increased by getting Experience Points, known as XP.
/TALKING HEAD (LV 81): Anything that doesn't give you Experience is, by definition, worthless.

/TALKING HEAD (LV 81): If you spent more time doing what's important then perhaps we wouldn't be having this conversation.

/PAWN: But, sir. I have 22 LV. The needed limit was 21 when I checked yesterday.
$CALL tvguy_change_pose
/TALKING HEAD (LV 81): Oh, you're right. We were forced to decrease the number of candidates due to the Everything Crisis.
/TALKING HEAD (LV 81): This meant increasing the required LV as well. It's 23 now.
/PAWN: Isn't there anything I can do?
/TALKING HEAD (LV 81): Aren't you familiar with our criteria?
$CALL play_background office.mp3
/TALKING HEAD (LV 81): You're lucky I'm in good mood today.
/TALKING HEAD (LV 81): It's possible to increase your XP by doing quests for individuals of LV 50 or more.
/TALKING HEAD (LV 81): From what I gathered you need 500 more XP to advance your Life Value.
/TALKING HEAD (LV 81): XP gain per quest can be found in the documentation I gave you.

- ASK FOR QUESTS
	/TALKING HEAD (LV 81): Most absolutely not.
	/TALKING HEAD (LV 81): That would be bribery and an offense against my esteemed position.
	/PAWN: I've heard you accept favors.
	/TALKING HEAD (LV 81): That's a lie.
	/TALKING HEAD (LV 81): If I were to theoretically ever accept any deal...
