//This is it. This is what you've come here for from the very beginning.

/TALKING HEAD: Your application has been...

/TALKING HEAD: Rejected.

//Shit.

$CALL tvguy_change_pose

/TALKING HEAD: It's nothing personal. You just weren't good enough.
/TALKING HEAD: As you know, our system chooses the best candidates based on your Life Value, LV for short.
/TALKING HEAD: Which in turn can be increased by getting Experience Points, known as XP.
/TALKING HEAD: Anything that doesn't give you Experience is, by definition, worthless.
$CALL tvguy_change_pose
/TALKING HEAD: If you spent more time doing what's important then perhaps we wouldn't be having this conversation.

//You try to pick up last pieces of your shattered dignity from the floor not to stutter.

/PAWN: But, sir. I have 22 LV. The needed limit was 21 when I checked yesterday.
$CALL tvguy_change_pose
/TALKING HEAD: Oh, you're right. We were forced to decrease the number of candidates due to the Everything Crisis.
/TALKING HEAD: This meant increasing the required LV as well. It's 23 now.
/PAWN: Isn't there anything I can do?
/TALKING HEAD: Aren't you familiar with our criteria?
/TALKING HEAD: You're lucky I'm in good mood today.
/TALKING HEAD: It's possible to inflate your XP by doing quests for individuals of LV 50 or more.
/TALKING HEAD: From what I gathered you need 500 more XP to advance your Life Value.
/TALKING HEAD: XP gain per quest can be found in the documentation I gave you.
$CALL tvguy_change_pose
- ASK FOR QUESTS
	/TALKING HEAD: Most absolutely not.
	/TALKING HEAD: That would be bribery and an offense against my esteemed position.
	- INQUIRE FURTHER
		/PAWN: I've heard you accept favors.
		/TALKING HEAD: That's a lie.
		/TALKING HEAD: If I were to theoretically ever accept any deal...
		/TALKING HEAD: It would theoretically not be from someone like you.
