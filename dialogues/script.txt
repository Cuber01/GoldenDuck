~ Intro
PAWN: 13 years of studying, 13 years of hard work just for this moment.
It's my only chance of getting the Golden Duck.
Without it, I'll never be content.

/Don't fuck this up.

~ Head Talk 1
TALKING HEAD: Welcome!
TALKING HEAD: I see you've come to see how we review your application.
Give me just a moment.

You see as the man slams a gargantuan pile of papers in front of you.

TALKING HEAD: This is our criteria. I am obligated by law to give you this.
PICKED UP/: 10kg of documents
TALKING HEAD: I VERY MUCH reccommend you read it. 
It will increase your chances by up to 4%.
- DOES IT ALWAYS HELP?
	TALKING HEAD: Nothing in life is guaranteed.
	TALKING HEAD: We have to take into account your reading skills,
	rivals, records, the current attitudes in the market...
	PAWN: Oh yes, of course.
- READ IT
	You start slowly going through the pile.
	As you place your fingers to move on to the next page, you briefly feel the paper's surface. 
	It's the most dry material you've ever touched.
	
	CHAPTER 1: PREAMBLE
	
	Head is eyeing you with a poker face.
	As you see there's no end in sight, you start skimming through at a faster pace.
	
	CHAPTER 2: DETAILED PREAMBLE
	
	The text bores you to death. And you still haven't learned anything.
	The man continues staring at you, menacingly.
	
	CHAPTER 3: LEGAL JUSTIFICATION
	
	You hear someone mumble. Are they getting impatient?
	You immdiatelly fall into pressure, and start scrolling through the pages at a breakneck pace.
	
	CHAPTER 4: FACTUAL JUSTIFICATION
	CHAPTER 5: APPLIED CONDITIONS
	CHAPTER 6: LESSER CRITERIA
	CHAPTER 8: ETHICAL CRITERIA
	CHAPTER 9: CONCLUSION
	CHAPTER 10: COMMENTARY
	
	PAWN: I'm finished!
	TALKING HEAD: Excellent!
- NO NEED
	TALKING HEAD: Erm... Are you sure?
	Talking Head seems genuinely confused.
	- YES
		TALKING HEAD: If you say so.
		You sense disgust in their voice.
	- NO
		TALKING HEAD: Read it, then.
TALKING HEAD: Since you are familiar with our criteria, 
we can start your evaluation.

This is it. This is what you've come here for from the very beginning.

TALKING HEAD: Unfortunately your application has been rejected.

Shit.

TALKING HEAD: It's nothing personal. You just weren't good enough.
TALKING HEAD: As you know, our system chooses the best candidates based on your Life Value, LV for short.
TALKING HEAD: Which, in turn, can be increased by getting relevant Experience Points â€” XP.
TALKING HEAD: Anything that doesn't give you Experience is, by definition, worthless.
TALKING HEAD: If you spent more time doing what's important then perhaps we wouldn't be having this conversation.

You try to pick up your last pieces of dignity from the floor not to stutter.

PAWN: But, sir. I have 22 LV. The needed limit was 21 when I checked yesterday.
TALKING HEAD: Oh, you're right. We were forced to decrease the number of candidates due to the Everything Crisis.
	This meant increasing the required LV as well. It's 23 now.
PAWN: Isn't there anything I can do?
>READ: TALKING HEAD: Haven't you read our criteria?
>NOT READ: TALKING HEAD: That's why you should've read our criteria, like I told you.
TALKING HEAD: You're lucky I'm in good mood today.
TALKING HEAD: You can temporarily inflate your XP by doing good deeds for individuals of LV 50 or more.
From what I see you need 500 more XP to advance your Life Value.
XP given per good deed can be found in the documentation I gave you.
- CAN I HELP YOU?
	TALKING HEAD: Most absolutely not.
	TALKING HEAD: That would be bribery and an offense against my esteemed position.
	- I'VE HEARD YOU ACCEPT FAVORS
		TALKING HEAD: That's a lie.
		TALKING HEAD: If I were to theoretically ever accept any deal,
		It would theoretically not be from someone like you.
	- OKAY
- FIND SOMEONE ELSE
PAWN: Thank you for your help, sir!
TALKING HEAD: There's one more thing you have to know.
TALKING HEAD: We're closing our application in 30 Time.
You need to hurry.
TALKING HEAD: Do what you have to.
GOT 10 XP FOR: CONVERSING WITH AN ESTEEMED OFFICIAL

~ Street
You're out on the streets. 

You see roaring cars ride through the City and dozens of people going places.

You decide to check out:
- LIGHTS
	As you lift your head upwards you're instantly blinded by the nearest lamp. In the City lights are always turned on.
	...
	You were in the slums, once. It's actually dark there during the night. 
	You're terrified by the mere thought of living there one day. 
	 You must get the Golden Duck. 
- STREET
	Eight lanes. Improves commerce.
- NEWSPAPER
	You find a week old newspaper on the ground.
	PICKED UP/: Soaked newspaper
	Two headlines catch your eye.
	THE EVERYTHING CRISIS: 20 YEAR ANNIVERSARY and NUCLEAR APOCALYPSE: CLOSER THAN EVER BEFORE?
	As you skim them through, it turns out that due to recent geopolitical developments there's a war on the horizon.
	That would jeopardize your efforts of getting the Golden Duck. Coincidentally you can do absolutely nothing about it.
	Unfortunate.
- PEOPLE
	Bystanders seem to be in a hurry. You look for someone high LV enough to gain XP by helping them, but it seems like everyone nearby is a low LV noob like yourself.
	Until... there it is!
	An elder woman with Life Value of 51.
- GRANDMA

~ Grandma
GRANDMA: Hello dearie. Would you like to help an old lady?
- HELP GRANDMA
	PAWN: Yes ma'am. What's the problem?
	GRANDMA: You see, I'd like to cross this street but I'm afraid I simply don't have the strength in me anymore.
	GRANDMA: Could you please take my groceries and hold me by my arm while we go through?
	You do what is asked of you and help the lady cross the street.
	GRANDMA: Thank you for your help. You are truly a wonderful young man.
	GOT 100 XP FOR: HELPING GRANDMA
	Damn, that's not enough.
- HELP GRANDMA 2
	You grab her by the arm.
	GRANDMA: What are you doing, dearie? We're on the right side of the road.
	Despite Grandma's objections, you pull her through the eight lanes of the street.
	GRANDMA: Huff puff.
	GRANDMA: I need to rest now. 
	GRANDMA: I'll search for another way to get through later.
	GOT 100 XP FOR: HELPING GRANDMA
	Still not enough.
- HELP GRANDMA 3
	You help grandma.
	GRANDMA: No, please, it's fine.
	She's trying to oppose you, but can't stand against your strength.
	Bystanders ignore you.
	You quickly get her through the street, barely avoiding one of the speeding cars.
	GRANDMA: Yes, thank you. Now leave me be, please.
	Grandma takes deep breaths. She's very tired.
	GOT 100 XP FOR: HELPING GRANDMA
	You're getting close.
- HELP GRANDMA 4
	You help grandma. She tries to unhelp herself. You help grandma.
	GOT 100 XP FOR: HELPING GRANDMA
	As you enter the sidewalk, she falls on the ground.
	PAWN: Fuck.
	There's no way you can find someone else to help. You don't have time.
	Maybe if you return to Talking Head you can still find a way to get the remaining XP.
	There's still hope!
	- RETURN TO TALKING HEAD
	- GIVE UP
- RETURN
