- DOES IT ALWAYS HELP?
	/TALKING HEAD: We have to take into account your reading skills,
	rivals, records, the current attitudes in the market...
	/PAWN: Oh yes, of course.

- READ IT
	//You start slowly going through the pile.
	//As you place your fingers to move on to the next page, you briefly feel the paper's surface. 
	//It's the driest material you've ever touched.

	//CHAPTER 1: PREAMBLE
	
	//Head is eyeing you with a poker face.
	//As you see there's no end in sight, you start skimming through at a faster pace.
	
	//CHAPTER 2: DETAILED PREAMBLE
	
	//The text bores you to death. And you still haven't learned anything.
	//The man continues staring at you, menacingly.
	
	//CHAPTER 3: LEGAL JUSTIFICATION
	
	//You hear someone mumble. Are they getting impatient?
	//You immdiatelly fall into pressure, and start scrolling through the pages at a breakneck pace.

/TALKING HEAD: Since you are familiar with our criteria, 
we can start your evaluation.

//This is it. This is what you've come here for from the very beginning.

/TALKING HEAD: Unfortunately your application has been rejected.

//Shit.

/TALKING HEAD: It's nothing personal. You just weren't good enough.
/TALKING HEAD: As you know, our system chooses the best candidates based on your Life Value, LV for short.
/TALKING HEAD: Which, in turn, can be increased by getting relevant Experience Points â€” XP.
/TALKING HEAD: Anything that doesn't give you Experience is, by definition, worthless.
/TALKING HEAD: If you spent more time doing what's important then perhaps we wouldn't be having this conversation.

//You try to pick up your last pieces of dignity from the floor not to stutter.

/PAWN: But, sir. I have 22 LV. The needed limit was 21 when I checked yesterday.
/TALKING HEAD: Oh, you're right. We were forced to decrease the number of candidates due to the Everything Crisis.
	This meant increasing the required LV as well. It's 23 now.
/PAWN: Isn't there anything I can do?
