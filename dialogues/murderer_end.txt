- TO DEFEAT THE SYSTEM
	/PAWN: I was pissed off by your shitty criteria. 
	/PAWN: Ordering me around like a child and treating like a spreadsheet.
	/TALKING HEAD (LV 75): Did you really think you could "defeat the system"?
	/TALKING HEAD (LV 74): With what? An axe?
	/TALKING HEAD: I am a pawn, just like you.
	/TALKING HEAD: Why do you think I have a TV instead of a head?
	/TALKING HEAD: I had it in me to do what was necessary. To climb the ladder, to get that sweet XP.
	/TALKING HEAD: Everyone respected me. I was at the top.
	/TALKING HEAD: And you fucked it all up.
	/TALKING HEAD: ALL OF IT!!!
